# coffee-inline-map

Compile CoffeeScript files with inline source maps.

## Features

* Error reporting similar to the original CoffeeScript compiler.
* `.litcoffee` support.

## Example

```
$ cat a.coffee
include([a.coffee])
$ coffee-inline-map a.coffee | fold -w72
syscmd([../../../bin/coffee-inline-map a.coffee | fold -w72])

$ coffee-inline-map -h
syscmd([../../../bin/coffee-inline-map -h])
```

## Installation

    # npm install -g coffee-inline-map

## Compilation

    $ make compile

## browserify & make-commonjs-depend

To verify the text below you'll need to clone this repo, run 'make
compile' & install
[[make-commonjs-depend]](https://github.com/gromnitsky/make-commonjs-depend).

Look into repo's `test/data` directory. Ignore `*.should` files. I'll wait.

Then

```
$ cd src
$ ls *coffee
syscmd([ls *coffee])
```

Here `main.coffee` depends on `a.coffee` & `b.litcoffee`. For out site
we need just 1 `public/bundle.js` file which will include the result form the
compilations of our all CoffeeScript files.

We want to rebuild `public/bundle.js` only & only on .coffee files
change. That's obviously a job for make.

```
$ cat Makefile
include([Makefile])
```

To create a dependency tree, we run

```
$ make depend
syscmd([make depend | egrep -v '(Entering|Leaving) directory'])
```

```
$ cat js.mk
include([js.mk])
```

It's unfortunate that make-commonjs-depend supports only
javascript. That's why before running it, make needs to compile all
coffescript files.

Then compile the bundle

```
$ make compile
syscmd([make compile | egrep -v '(Entering|Leaving) directory'])
```

As a little homework, try to guess why `main.js` was recompiled here,
when at first glance it should rather not.

Run again

```
$ make compile
syscmd([make compile | egrep -v '(Entering|Leaving) directory'])
```

Notice that the nothing was recompiled for the 2nd time. That's our goal!

```
$ touch a.coffee
$ make compile
syscmd([touch a.coffee; make compile | egrep -v '(Entering|Leaving) directory'])
```

Yay! Then open `public/index.html` in Chrome and switch to the console
view. (Make sure to turn on 'Enable source maps' in Developer Tool's
settings.)

## Jeez mate, why are you doing this rigmarole?

Every dependency & every file should be compiled/processed only once.

This seems meaningless for a bunch of small .coffee files but becomes
very useful for large projects with several complex browserify output
targets.

## Why not just use coffeeify plugin for browserify?

1. browserify can't (& shouldn't) check changes in our source files to
   decide whether it's time to recompile.
2. Error reporting.

## Why are you using outdated make instead of cake, jake, grunt, gulp or broccoli? It's not 1977 anymore!
